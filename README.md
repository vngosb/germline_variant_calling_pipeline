# Germline Variant Calling Pipeline

A reproducible **Nextflow DSL2** workflow for germline variant calling from paired-end Illumina sequencing data. This pipeline performs quality control, adapter trimming, read alignment, BAM processing, and variant calling using widely adopted bioinformatics tools.

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a modular and reproducible NGS analysis workflow using Nextflow DSL2. Starting from raw paired-end FASTQ files, the pipeline automates each processing step to generate germline variant calls in VCF format.

The workflow was developed as a portfolio project to demonstrate practical experience with workflow development, pipeline automation, and best practices in computational genomics.

## Input

The pipeline accepts paired-end Illumina FASTQ files:

```
sample_1.fastq.gz
sample_2.fastq.gz
```

---

## Output

The workflow produces:

- FastQC quality reports
- Trimmed FASTQ files
- Aligned BAM files
- Sorted and indexed BAM files
- Germline variant calls (VCF)

---

## Running the Pipeline

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vngosb/germline-variant-calling-pipeline.git
cd germline-variant-calling-pipeline
```

Run the workflow:

```bash
nextflow run main.nf
```
